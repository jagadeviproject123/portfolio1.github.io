<div class="python2"><h1>Why and How to learn Python Programming Language?</h1></div>
<div class="python3">
<p>Python is the programming language behind giant applications like YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Uber, Netflix, and many more apps.<br>
But are you still wondering whether or not you should learn it? Should you add it to your knowledge stack? <br><br>
Direct answer- Yes! Learning it will assure you a great job, a high package, brilliant opportunities, amazing communities, <br>
and a successful and fulfilling software development career.Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level software <br>
development language developed in 1991, yet recently gained popularity with the 3rd version of Python ( Python 3). <br>
Let’s look at the reasons for the language’s popularity and how you can learn Python in the most engaging and practical way.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="container15">
<div class="complex1"><h1>Why was Python developed?</h1></div>
<div class="complex2">
<p>Guido van Rossum, a software developer, got frustrated with the complex and tedious languages he was working with. <br> 
Hence in the 1980s, he picked the project of developing a syntactically beautiful, simple, easy, and fun-to-use language. <br> 
Fun! The name suggests that already. But to understand what made Python one of the most loved programming languages continue <br>
reading below.</p></div>
</div> 
<div class="language">
<div class="language1"><h1>Features of Python Language</h1></div>
<div class="language2"><p>Here are the 5 major reasons that make the Python language so popular with a fan base 
calling themselves “Pythonistas”.</p></div>
<div class="language3">
<p class="begin">1.Python is beginner-friendly:</p>
<p>
Python features very closely with the English syntax and is super easy to read even by someone,not a coder. It uses fewer <br>
lines of code and simple rules with no semicolon at the end of every line or confusing brackets. </p>
<p class="begin">2. Python is Easy to Learn:</p>
<p>
Python’s rules and syntax are very easy compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. Another thing that makes <br>
Python simple is that it is an interpreted language. Interpreted language means when you write a program in C or C++, you write <br>
the complete code and then check for errors in the compiler. But with Python, you can check if your code is error-free in every <br>
line and correct if it’s wrong.</p>
<p class="begin">3. Python is highly versatile:</p>
<p>
Python can be used for small projects, say making a calculator, and for big and complex tasks such as web development, <br> 
data analytics, etc. This is possible due to the pre-written codes you can use directly and build upon. These <br>
pre-written codes are called Python libraries and frameworks.Once you learn the basics of Python through self-study, <br>
a degree, or a course, you’ll be able to understand a huge amount of code developed by other programmers.</p>
<p class="begin">4. Python is super flexible:</p>
<p>
Python offers flexibility with the platform it is used upon. You can easily run the Python code you wrote on Windows<br>
over Linux or macOS without making any changes. Another exciting feature of Python is that it can run along with other<br>
programming languages such as Java (Jython) or C Language (CPython).</p>
<p class="begin">5. Free and Open-Source:</p>
<p>
Python is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. It doesn’t cost anything to download Python or to include <br>
it in your application. It can also be freely modified and re-distributed. You can download Python from the official Python <br>
website.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="appli">
<div class="language1"><h1>Applications of Python Language</h1></div>
<div class="language2"><p>With incredible versatility, Python has a wide range of applications. Some major fields where Python 
language is used are</p></div>
<div class="language3">
   <p>1. Web development (Backend)</p>
   <p>2. Software development</p> 
   <p>3. Data Analytics</p> 
   <p>4. Machine Learning</p>
   <p>5. Artificial Intelligence</p>
   <p>6. Mathematical Analysis</p>
   <p>7. System Scripting and</p> 
   <p>8. Cyber Security <p></div>
</div>
<div class="community">
<div class="language1"><h1>Why learn Python Language?</h1></div>
<div class="language2">
<p>With an ever-growing community of Python users and its versatility and wide applications,it has become the most popular <br> 
programming language (leaving behind Java and C++). It has got abundant libraries, various frameworks, modules and file <br>
extensions.</p></div>
<div class="language2"><p>Here are the top 3 reasons Python is a great place to start and take your coding journey to heights.</p></div>
<div class="language3">
<p>1. High demand for Python programmers</p>
<p>2. Growing communities across the globe.</p>
<p>3. Fastest growing programming language</p></div>
</div>
<div class="how">
<div class="how1"><h1>How to begin with Python?</h1></div>
<div class="how2">
<p>Now, if you have realized the grandeur of Python language in software development and wish to learn the language basics <br>
and level up, you can start with Tap Academy’s course.</p></div>
<div class="how3"><p>Tap Academy is the first institute to use Augmented Reality in teaching computer science concepts from the <br>
absolute basics. Our students get unlimited placement opportunities to showcase their expertise after 50+ video <br>
lessons,150+ practice questions, discussion forums, live doubt-clearing sessions, and an overall transformation <br>
with our personality development & resume-building module. Tap Academy mentors are the cherry on the cake; <br>
they would help you with all the personal guidance required.</p></div>
