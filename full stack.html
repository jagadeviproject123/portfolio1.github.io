<div class="full1"><h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1></div>
<div class="full2">
<p>A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer.<br> 
They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS,JavaScript, databases,<br>
servers, APIs, and frameworks,among others. <br><br> 
Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the <br>
application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project. <br><br> 
In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end <br>
using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular <br>
to speed up the development process. <br><br>
In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and <br>
PHP.To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB. <br><br>
The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications <br>
would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer. <br><br> 
The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working <br>
on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and <br>
problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high demand in the software development sector.</p></div>

<div class="task">Full Stack Developers frequently handle the following tasks:</div>
<div class="task1">
<p class="task2">1.Web application creation and upkeep:</p>
<p class="task3">Full Stack From the front end to the back end, developers are in charge of designing,creating, and managing online applications. <br>
To produce a seamless user experience, they collaborate with a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies.</p>
<p class="task2">2.Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams:</p>
<p class="task3">To make sure the web application is meeting business and user needs, Full Stack Developers collaborate with cross-functional <br>
teams that include designers, product managers, and other developers.</p>
<p class="task2">3.Software implementation and testing:</p>
<p class="task3">Full Stack Developers are in charge of putting software solutions into practice and testing them to make sure they work as <br>
intended. To ensure accuracy and quality, they employ a variety of testing frameworks and techniques. </p>
<p class="task2">4.Debugging and troubleshooting problems:</p>
<p class="task3">Full Stack Developers are in charge of finding and fixing problems with web applications. To identify issues and create <br>
workable solutions, they employ debugging tools and methods.</p> </div>
</div>
<div class="container17">
<div class="full3"><h1>Skills Required for Full Stack Development</h1></div>
<div class="full2">
<p>1. Having a deep grasp of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as front-end frameworks like React<br>
   or Angular is a requirement for Full Stack Developers. <br><br>
2. Understanding of back-end development is also essential for Full Stack Developers, who must be well-versed in server-side<br>
   programming languages like Node.js or PHP and databases like MySQL or MongoDB. <br><br>
3. The ability to create and integrate APIs, which are necessary for connecting various components of a web application,is a <br>
   requirement for Full Stack Developers. <br><br>
4. Controlling versions: Full Stack Since version control tools like Git are used to manage and track changes in the codebase, <br>
   developers need to be knowledgeable in these programs. <br><br>
5. Full Stack Developers must have good problem-solving and troubleshooting abilities in order to recognize and fix problems <br>
   with online applications.</p></div>
