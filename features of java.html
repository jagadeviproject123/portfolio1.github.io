<div class="para2"><h1>Features of Java Explained</h1></div>
 <div class="para3">
<p>The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. <br>
Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability.<br>
Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main factors <br>
in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows <br>
automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks <br>to its 
built-in support for multithreading and security features. In addition, Java features a simple syntax <br>
and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use. <br><br>
Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used <br>
language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, which have made <br>
it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike. <br><br>
Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to <br> 
create sophisticated applications.There are many useful classes and functions in Java’s standard library, <br>
and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more
capability.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="advantage">
<div class="adva1"><h2>Advantages of using Java</h2></div>
 <div class="adva2"><p>The use of Java as a programming language has a number of benefits. 
Some of the main benefits are as follows:</p></div>
<div class="adva2">
<p> 1. Java is a straightforward programming language since it is simple 
to  2. learn and comprehend.</p>
<p> 3. Java uses implicit pointers, making it a secure programming language.</p> 
<p> 4. Java code does not need to be constantly compiled in order to execute on a variety of systems.</p>
<p> 5. Java has strong memory management, making it a robust programming language.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="feature">
 <div class="feature1"><h2>Features of Java</h2></div>
 <div class="feature2"><p>A list of the most important features of the Java language is given 
below:</p></div>
<div class="feature3">
 <p class="feature4 future">1.Platform independent:</p>
<p class="feature4">
Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, meaning that Java code can run without  any changes on any <br>
platform that supports Java.</p>
 <p class="feature4 future">2.Object-oriented language:</p>
 <p class="feature4">
Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers to create modular, reusable code components known <br>
as objects, making it simpler to develop and maintain complex programmes.</p>
 <p class="feature4 future">3.Automatic memory management:</p>
 <p class="feature4">
Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves developers of the need to manually handle<br>
memory allocation and deallocation.</p>
 <p class="feature4 future" >4.Security:</p>
<p class="feature4">
Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorised access and shield users from potential <br>
security risks. Java was created with security in mind.</p>
 <p class="feature4 future">5.Rich API:</p>
 <p class="feature4">
The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a wide range of <br>
practical tools for creating applications.</p>
 <p class="feature4 future">6.Multi-threading support:</p>
 <p class="feature4">
Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to create concurrent aplications <br>
that can handle running several threads at once.</p>
 <p class="feature4 future">7.High performance:</p>
<p class="feature4">
Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimises code execution while it is running.</p>
 <p class="feature4 future">8.Scalability:</p>
 <p class="feature4">
Java’s modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create large-scale programmes <br>
that can be scaled up or down based on demand.</p>
 <p class="feature4 future">9.Simplified syntax:</p>
<p class="feature4">
Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, making it simpler for developers to write <br>
 and read code.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="conclude">
<div class="conclude1"><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
<div class="conclude2">
<p>Although learning Java may initially appear difficult, there are many tools accessible to assist you in comprehending<br>
its concepts and functionalities. One such tool is Tap Academy, a website for learning how to code that provides <br>
a range of classes, including Java. Java can be learned with Tap Academy at your own pace, with clear explanations <br>
and useful activities that help you develop your abilities and confidence.</p></div>
